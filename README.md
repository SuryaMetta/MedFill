# MedFill
MediFill is a mobile app prototype designed to simplify medicine management by allowing users to track their medications, set reminders, and receive expiry alerts. Built using React Native and Expo, the prototype focuses on offline functionality with AsyncStorage for local data storage and a clean UI powered by Context API. Users can add medicines manually or capture labels using the camera, manage multiple profiles, and locate nearby pharmacies via Google Maps. This prototype lays the foundation for future enhancements, including AI-powered OCR, cloud storage, and advanced interaction warnings.
